why does this thing even exist?
I'm currently starting to move whatever I find on my HDD on here, and whatever I'm working on.
Currently using C++ for USACO, but Java for some other stuffs. I dunno any cool python tricks, don't use it much.
I'm a noob af "competetive" programmer just slapping his files on here so he doesn't lose them. Primary tools are Dev-C++ and repl.it (when I'm at school on a chromebook).
